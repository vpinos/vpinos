# /etc/vpinos/gpu-driver -- called via `sudo` from launch.sh, on every
# single invocation (cheap/idempotent if nothing needs to change), right
# before it execs Hyprland. That's the one point every client type
# (vpinball/vpinfe/Chrome/installer/vpxconfig/gamepadtest) already goes
# through, live or installed, and nothing graphical has started yet at
# that point in any of them -- so nothing holds either driver's DRM
# device open, and this never needs a reboot to take effect, unlike the
# "Boot on startup" mode switch (see vpinos-menu.sh's "GPU Driver"
# option and notes/vpinos.md step 5 for the full reasoning).

# root-only: modprobe needs CAP_SYS_MODULE, which `vpinos` doesn't have
# and shouldn't -- see /etc/sudoers.d/vpinos, scoped to this one script
# specifically, same narrow-scope reasoning as every other rule there.

# Releases the kernel's own framebuffer console from whichever DRM
# driver currently owns it -- required before that driver's kernel
# module can actually be removed. Confirmed directly as the real root
# cause of a driver-switch failure on real NVIDIA hardware (a GTX 1650):
# `modprobe -r nouveau` below looked harmless (failures silently
# discarded by `|| true`) but was actually failing every time, visible
# directly in `dmesg` as "GPU ... is already bound to nouveau" / "No
# NVIDIA devices probed" immediately after -- nouveau was never
# unloaded, so nvidia's own probe correctly found the device still
# owned by nouveau and refused it. Root cause: nouveau is always
# actively bound to the real VT console at the point this script runs
# -- vpinos-menu's own text console deliberately runs on nouveau's real
# KMS driver (see 0120-install-nvidia-driver.hook.chroot's own history
# on why the nouveau blacklist is removed), and the kernel refuses to
# unload any module its own framebuffer console (fbcon) still holds a
# reference to, no matter what `modprobe -r`'s exit code says. Writing
# `0` to the bound vtconsole's own `bind` file releases that reference
# first. Symmetric problem in the reverse direction too -- switching
# back to "default" mode while nvidia-drm's own fbdev=1 console (from a
# previous "nvidia" session) is what's currently bound -- so this runs
# before both directions' module removal, not just the nvidia branch.

# caused two real symptoms on a real multi-launch session (vpinfe, then
# vpinball, both in "default" mode, no actual switch ever needed
# between them): launches got noticeably slower, and -- worse -- the
# vpinos-menu text console stopped updating after exiting back to it
# entirely (menu kept running fine, new selections still launched, the
# screen just never repainted again). Root cause: unbind_fbcon()
# unconditionally released the console's framebuffer binding every
# time, but nothing ever rebinds it -- the kernel only auto-rebinds a
# vtconsole when a driver is freshly (re)loaded and registers a new
# framebuffer; if the driver was already loaded and nothing actually
# got removed/reloaded (the common case -- most sessions don't flip
# gpu-driver mode between every single launch), no new framebuffer ever
# gets registered, so the explicitly-unbound vtconsole just stays
# unbound forever, with nothing left attached to draw the console.
# Checking already-loaded modules first and skipping entirely when
# they already match the desired mode avoids ever unbinding anything
# that doesn't need to change, which sidesteps this permanently rather
# than trying to add a matching rebind step.
