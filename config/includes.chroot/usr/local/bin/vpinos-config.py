# Cabinet configuration tool -- was vpinos-detect-monitors.py/"Monitor
# Detection" in the menu, renamed once it grew well past just
# monitors (VPinball Mode, Cabinet Autofit, Full DMD, Screen
# Dimensions, vpinfe's own screen ids). Starts with the original
# monitor-mapping piece: enumerate connected outputs via hyprctl, let the
# cabinet builder click SHOW next to a monitor to display its info
# fullscreen on the physical screen it actually is (so the output name
# can be matched to a real screen), pick a role (Table/Backglass/DMD)
# for each, and Save to write the
# `workspace = N, monitor:NAME, default:true` lines into hyprland.conf's
# vpinos-workspace-monitors block -- those lines, combined with the
# per-title windowrules already in hyprland.conf (which route
# vpinball's/vpinfe's own windows to workspace 1/2/3 by title), are what
# actually puts Table/Backglass/DMD on the right physical screen. Also
# has a last "VPinball Mode" option (Desktop/Cabinet) that Save writes
# straight into vpinball's own VPinballX.ini (BGSet, plus
# BackglassOutput/ScoreViewOutput based on which roles got assigned).
# With more than one monitor, Save also writes vpinfe's own
# tablescreenid/bgscreenid/dmdscreenid in vpinfe.ini to each role's
# monitor ID. Selecting Cabinet mode reveals three more sections
# (CabinetAutofitMode; a Full DMD on/off checkbox for
# ScoreViewDMDOverlay/ScoreViewDMDAutoPos/B2SHideGrill; and
# ScreenWidth/ScreenHeight/ScreenInclination), all written to
# VPinballX.ini -- hidden entirely in Desktop mode, since VPinballX.ini's
# own comments say they only matter in Cabinet mode. Save also always
# sets Priority.ScoreView/PUP/B2SLegacyDMD to fixed values, regardless
# of mode or role assignment.
#
# The UI is a small local web server (stdlib http.server only, no
# dependencies) plus a plain HTML/JS/CSS page in ./vpinos-config-web/,
# opened in `google-chrome --app=...` -- same look/feel as the sibling
# tool vpxconfig, and for the same reason: Tk was clunky here (no native
# Wayland backend, needed Xwayland; its Combobox popups got caught by
# hyprland.conf's kiosk fullscreen windowrule, forcing radio-button
# workarounds throughout).
#
# UNLIKE vpxconfig, this tool genuinely needs Hyprland already running
# (every hyprctl call below) -- it is NOT a standalone server vpinos-menu.sh
# starts directly before Hyprland exists. It is launch.sh's CLIENT, same
# role Chrome plays for vpxconfig and the old Tk GUI played here before
# this rewrite: launch.sh starts Hyprland, waits for its Wayland socket,
# then runs this script, which gets its monitor list via hyprctl, starts
# its own HTTP server, and THEN spawns google-chrome itself (see main())
# pointed at that server -- Chrome is this script's child, not
# launch.sh's. Run via vpinos-menu.sh option 1, or directly:
#   /usr/local/bin/launch.sh vpinos-config /usr/local/bin/vpinos-config.py
# launch.sh routes client_name "vpinos-config" to the windowed/floating
# hyprland-installer.conf (same case arm as "vpxconfig"/"installer"),
# not the kiosk config -- a config tool needs a visible, obvious way to
# close it. launch.sh kills Hyprland once this script's process exits,
# so main() waits for whichever of {Chrome, the HTTP server} stops
# first and tears down the other before returning.
