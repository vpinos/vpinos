# Cabinet configuration tool -- was vpinos-detect-monitors.py/"Monitor
# Detection" in the menu, renamed once it grew well past just
# monitors (VPinball Mode, Cabinet Autofit, Full DMD, Screen
# Dimensions, vpinfe's own screen ids). Starts with the original
# monitor-mapping piece: enumerate connected outputs via hyprctl, let the
# cabinet builder click SHOW next to a monitor to display its info
# fullscreen on the physical screen it actually is (so the output name
# can be matched to a real screen), pick a role (Table/Backglass/DMD)
# for each, and Save to write the
# `workspace = N, monitor:NAME, default:true` lines into hyprland.conf's
# vpinos-workspace-monitors block -- those lines, combined with the
# per-title windowrules already in hyprland.conf (which route
# vpinball's/vpinfe's own windows to workspace 1/2/3 by title), are what
# actually puts Table/Backglass/DMD on the right physical screen. Also
# has a last "VPinball Mode" option (Desktop/Cabinet) that Save writes
# straight into vpinball's own VPinballX.ini (BGSet, plus
# BackglassOutput/ScoreViewOutput based on which roles got assigned).
# With more than one monitor, Save also writes vpinfe's own
# tablescreenid/bgscreenid/dmdscreenid in vpinfe.ini to each role's
# monitor ID. Selecting Cabinet mode reveals three more sections
# (CabinetAutofitMode; a Full DMD on/off checkbox for
# ScoreViewDMDOverlay/ScoreViewDMDAutoPos/B2SHideGrill; and
# ScreenWidth/ScreenHeight/ScreenInclination), all written to
# VPinballX.ini -- hidden entirely in Desktop mode, since VPinballX.ini's
# own comments say they only matter in Cabinet mode. Save also always
# sets Priority.ScoreView/PUP/B2SLegacyDMD to fixed values, regardless
# of mode or role assignment.
#
# Run as a launch.sh "shell" client, same pattern as the debug terminal
# (`launch.sh shell /usr/bin/foot`) -- Hyprland needs to already be up
# with WAYLAND_DISPLAY set, which launch.sh's own launch_client() handles;
# this script doesn't start Hyprland itself:
#   /usr/local/bin/launch.sh shell /usr/local/bin/vpinos-config.py
#
# The menu itself is a real GUI (tkinter, via python3-tk) rather than a
# terminal menu -- runs over Xwayland (`xwayland { enabled = true }` is
# already on in hyprland.conf), so DISPLAY has to be discovered and set
# before any tkinter import touches a display, same idea as launch.sh's
# own installer-specific DISPLAY handling, just done here instead since
# launch.sh's generic "shell" client path only sets up Wayland.
