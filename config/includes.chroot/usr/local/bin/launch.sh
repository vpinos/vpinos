# "going into a TTY and executing Hyprland", not a login manager -- see
# `man hyprland`) and launches a given client as its client once the
# Wayland socket is up. Run directly from an interactive shell (the
# `vpinos` user for vpinball/vpinfe/Chrome -- seatd's default config
# already grants DRM/seat access to `video`-group members, no root
# needed; still `sudo`'d for the installer specifically, which genuinely
# needs root for partitioning -- see vpinos-menu.sh); not a systemd
# service. (Was weston until this was migrated to Hyprland -- see
# notes/vpinos.md step 5 for why, and for what carried over unchanged:
# this whole tty-session-instead-of-a-service architecture, the client
# wait/log/kill-on-exit mechanics below, none of that is Hyprland-
# specific, just the compositor binary and its config files changed.)

# Multi-GPU exclusion of an unused Intel iGPU -- a real report,
# confirmed directly over a live SSH session (not guessed, not
# reproduced via any rebuild): a real cabinet PC with an Intel iGPU
# (CPU/motherboard, driver i915, nothing physically connected to it --
# confirmed via `lspci -k`) alongside a discrete GPU (the one actually
# driving every monitor) hung/black-screened identically across every
# client and every gpu-driver mode (nouveau AND nvidia). Root cause
# confirmed via a direct SSH-launched vpinball run: BGFX fatally failed
# to initialize while printing "MESA-INTEL: ... Ivy Bridge Vulkan
# support is incomplete" immediately before the fatal error -- Intel's
# own Vulkan driver, not the discrete GPU's, despite nothing being
# connected to that GPU at all. This reframes the entire "nvidia black
# screen" investigation above and in notes/nvidia-proprietary.md: the
# actual root cause was never nvidia-driver-specific -- it reproduced
# identically under plain nouveau too. None of this file's own
# nvidia-only env vars above could ever have fixed it.
#
# Two separate things needed fixing, confirmed by testing each in
# isolation over that same live SSH session before combining them:
#   1. AQ_DRM_DEVICES (Hyprland's own Aquamarine backend env var,
#      confirmed as a real key via `strings` on the shipped
#      libaquamarine.so) -- controls which GPU(s) HYPRLAND ITSELF uses
#      for compositing/KMS. Confirmed fixed in isolation first: a
#      plain `foot` terminal (a simple Wayland client) rendered
#      correctly once this alone was set, proving Hyprland had been
#      choosing the Intel iGPU as its primary GPU.
#   2. VK_ICD_FILENAMES (the Vulkan LOADER's own standard env var, not
#      Hyprland-specific) -- controls which Vulkan ICDs a CLIENT's own
#      direct `vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices()` call can even see.
#      AQ_DRM_DEVICES alone did NOT fix vpinball, confirmed directly
#      (foot worked, vpinball still failed with only AQ_DRM_DEVICES
#      set) -- because vpinball (BGFX) does its own independent Vulkan
#      device enumeration, completely bypassing whatever GPU Hyprland
#      itself composites on. Restricting the loader to only the
#      correct ICD stops it from ever seeing Intel's own
#      (`intel_icd.json`/`intel_hasvk_icd.json`) at all. Confirmed
#      fixed with both set together: vpinball actually launched and
#      rendered a real table.
#
# Detected dynamically by real PCI vendor ID (confirmed via the PCI ID
# database: 0x8086 = Intel, 0x10de = NVIDIA, 0x1002 = AMD) rather than
# hardcoded card numbers or assumed PCI enumeration order -- neither is
# guaranteed stable across boots or hardware. Only acts when BOTH an
# Intel GPU AND some other (non-Intel) GPU are present -- a genuine
# hybrid machine like this one -- and does nothing at all on a plain
# single-GPU machine, this project's own main dev hardware (an AMD RX
# 9060 XT with no separate Intel iGPU enabled) included, where
# Hyprland/Vulkan's own single-device defaults are already correct and
