# Populates ~/tables from a GitHub repo of sample tables
# (https://github.com/superhac/vpinos-test-tables), on first boot only.
# NOT enabled by default as of 1.0.36+ -- 3 of the 4 tables are bundled
# directly at build time instead (0105-bundle-sample-tables.hook.chroot),
# since that build's ISO size left enough headroom under GitHub's 2 GiB
# release-asset limit for most of the set (see notes/vpinos.md for the
# exact numbers). This script and its service are left in place,
# untouched, for exactly the scenario the bundling comment describes --
# re-enable `vpinos-fetch-tables.service` in
# 0200-enable-kiosk.hook.chroot to go back to download-on-boot for all
# 4 tables instead. Run as a systemd service (see
# vpinos-fetch-tables.service), as the `vpinos` user directly -- not
# root, not sudo'd -- so whatever it creates is already correctly
# owned, no chown-after-the-fact needed.
#
# Works identically live or installed, no is_installed()-style gate
# needed: a live session never persists ~/tables across a reboot, so it
# genuinely re-downloads every boot (same content, same URL, idempotent
# in effect even though not in mechanism); an installed system only
# ever downloads once, since every boot after the first finds ~/tables
# already populated and skips straight past.
