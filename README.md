## What it is

VPinOS is a custom Debian 13 (trixie) image, built with
[live-build](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/), that ships as
a single hybrid ISO. It is **not** a general-purpose desktop. The whole point
is a cabinet that goes from power-on to pinball with as little OS in the way
as possible:

- **Base:** Debian trixie with `trixie-backports` enabled. The **Linux 7.1
  kernel**, a current **Mesa (26.1)** and current **AMD GPU firmware** come
  from backports so recent GPUs work out of the box (see
  [Requirements](#requirements)); everything else is stock trixie.
- **Display:** [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) as the compositor,
  with the launched program as its only Wayland client.
- **Graphics:** open-source Mesa Vulkan drivers (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA via
  NVK) on the Linux 7.1 kernel, so VPinball's BGFX renderer runs with a
  real GPU.
- **Apps:** `vpinball` and `vpinfe` (a cabinet frontend/launcher), plus
  Google Chrome for vpinfe's local UI.
- **Account:** one hardcoded appliance user, `vpinos` (password `vpinos`),
  in the `video`, `input`, `audio`, `render`, `dialout`, `plugdev` and
  `sudo` groups. The apps run
  as this user, not as root.

## Live vs. installed

The same image runs two ways. Everything is identical except where it lives
and whether changes survive a reboot.

|                       | **Live** (boot the USB stick)                    | **Installed** (on the cabinet's disk)              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| How you get it        | Write the ISO to a USB stick and boot it         | Run the installer from the live session ("Install VPinOS") |
| Storage               | Read-only image, changes held in RAM             | Normal read-write install                          |
| Changes persist?      | **No** &mdash; everything resets on reboot       | Yes                                                |
| Login                 | Console autologin as `vpinos` on tty1            | Console autologin as `vpinos` on tty1              |
| Start the menu        | automatic on login                               | automatic on login                                 |
| `sudo`                | Passwordless (live session default)              | Asks for the `vpinos` password, except the launcher the menu uses |
| Updating vpinball / vpinfe | Not useful (lost at reboot) &mdash; use a newer ISO | `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`          |
| Good for              | Trying it, hardware checks, running the installer | Daily use on the cabinet                          |

The **live** session is the way to try VPinOS on a machine without touching
its disks. To make it permanent, pick **Install VPinOS** from
the menu and follow the prompts (language, keyboard, partitioning, summary).

### The menu

The menu launches automatically on login — a plain numbered shell prompt
("Quit to shell" drops to a normal shell, e.g. for debugging — running
`vpinos-menu` by hand brings it back). The top level differs slightly
between the live session and an installed system:

```
live session                      installed system
--------------------------------  --------------------------------
1) Setup                          1) Setup
2) Testing                        2) VPinFE
3) Install VPinOS                 3) Testing
4) System Info (Debug)            4) System Info (Debug)
q) Quit to shell                  q) Quit to shell
s) Shutdown                       s) Shutdown
```

"Setup" groups everything that configures the cabinet rather than runs it:

```
1) GPU Driver: default
2) VPinOS Configuration
3) Network Settings
4) VPXConfig (Advanced VPinball Configuration)
5) VPinFE Map Controls
6) Boot on startup: menu       (installed systems only)
```

"VPinOS Configuration" (`vpinos-config.py` — was "Monitor Detection" until it
grew past just monitors) starts a local web server and opens it in a
windowed Chrome, same pattern as "VPXConfig" below (`127.0.0.1:1112`, this
machine only, stopped as soon as you close the browser): identify which
output name (`DP-2`, `HDMI-A-1`, ...) is which physical screen, assign each
one a role (Table/Backglass/DMD) and refresh rate, set VPinball
Mode/Rendering Options, and save straight into
`hyprland.conf`/`VPinballX.ini`.

"Network Settings" runs `nmtui`, NetworkManager's own text UI — edit or
activate Ethernet/Wi-Fi connections, and set the system hostname. Not
Wi-Fi-specific despite the common association.

"VPXConfig" starts a configuration tool with a web interface: the menu
starts its local server (`127.0.0.1:1111`, this machine only), opens it in a
windowed Chrome, and stops the server as soon as you close the browser (or
click its own Quit button).

"VPinFE Map Controls" runs `vpinfe --gamepadtest`, vpinfe's own
controller-mapping mode.

"Boot on startup" (installed systems only — not shown on the live image) lets
you pick a program to launch automatically on boot instead of this menu, e.g.
VPinFE for a cabinet that should go straight to the frontend. Quitting that
program (or it exiting for any other reason) always falls back to this menu,
never a dead end.

"Testing" groups things you run to try the cabinet out, rather than
configure it:

```
1) Launch VPinball Example Table
2) VPinFE       (live session only)
```

VPinFE itself — the cabinet's table-browsing frontend — is tucked into
Testing on the live session (there's nowhere else to reach it from), but
promoted to its own top-level option on an installed system: that's the one
a cabinet builder reaches for constantly once it's actually built, so it
doesn't sit a menu level down from day-to-day use.

"GPU Driver" switches between the open-source driver this image uses by
default (Mesa/NVK on NVIDIA hardware, RADV on AMD, Intel's own driver) and
the NVIDIA proprietary driver, precompiled into the image at build time.
Takes effect on the very next launch — no reboot needed, live or installed.
Off by default: Hyprland/Wayland compatibility with the proprietary driver
hasn't been independently verified on real hardware by this project.

"Shutdown" asks for confirmation, then powers the machine off.

The menu is a deliberate placeholder to prove out the launch path; booting
straight into the frontend is still to come.

## Releases

Prebuilt ISOs are published on the
[**Releases**](../../releases) page.

- A release is created **only when a version tag** (`v1.2.3`, matching the
  version stamped into the image) is pushed. The `Build VPinOS ISO` GitHub
  Actions workflow builds the image from a clean checkout and attaches it.
- Each release contains:
  - `live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso` &mdash; the image (roughly 2&nbsp;GB)
  - `live-image-amd64.packages` &mdash; every package and version in the image
  - `live-image-amd64.contents` / `.files` &mdash; the full file listing
- Pushes to `main` and manual runs build the image and upload it as a
  short-lived workflow artifact for verification, but do not create a release.
- The version shown on the boot splash, in the installer, on the login
  banner and in `/etc/os-release` all come from that one file:
  [`config/includes.chroot/etc/os-release`](config/includes.chroot/etc/os-release).

### Using an ISO

1. Download `live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso` from the latest release.
2. Write it to a USB stick (this **erases** the stick), for example:
   ```bash
   sudo dd if=live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
   ```
   or use a tool such as balenaEtcher. Double-check `/dev/sdX` first.
3. Boot the target machine from the stick. The image carries both BIOS
   (syslinux) and UEFI (GRUB) boot files.
4. Run `vpinos-menu`. To install, choose "Install VPinOS".

### Requirements

- x86-64 PC with a Vulkan-capable GPU. The image ships the **Linux 7.1
  kernel, Mesa 26.1 and current AMD GPU firmware from Debian's
  trixie-backports** (trixie's own 6.12 kernel and Mesa 25.0 are too old for
  the newest cards). VPinOS uses only the **open-source Mesa drivers**
  &mdash; no proprietary AMD or NVIDIA drivers &mdash; and they are all
  included, so no driver install is needed:
  - **AMD** &mdash; Mesa RADV
  - **Intel** &mdash; Mesa Intel Vulkan
  - **NVIDIA** &mdash; the open-source NVK driver (Mesa) with NVIDIA's GPU
    firmware, for Turing (RTX 16/20-series) and newer cards. Not yet tested
    on real NVIDIA hardware. Older NVIDIA cards (Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal
    &mdash; e.g. Quadro K-series, GTX 900/10-series) are not known to have a
    working Vulkan driver here (untested with the newer Mesa): the kernel's
    `nouveau` driver still runs the display, but Vulkan may fall back to
    software (see below). Whether OpenGL on those cards is usable for
    vpinball is untested.
- **How to tell if your GPU is being used:** run `vulkaninfo --summary`. If
  the device is `llvmpipe` (or `lavapipe`), Vulkan is falling back to
  software rendering on the CPU &mdash; the GPU isn't supported, and it will
  be far too slow for pinball.
- The installer sets up a **UEFI** boot (GRUB EFI). Installing onto a
  BIOS-only machine has not been tested.
- A network connection is needed to update, and for the sample tables
  below on first boot, but not otherwise to run.

### NVIDIA video card support

Besides the open-source NVK driver above (the default, no install needed),
VPinOS can also precompile NVIDIA's **proprietary** driver at build time and
let you switch to it at runtime from the console menu (`vpinos-menu` &rarr;
"GPU Driver" &rarr; "NVIDIA proprietary"). As of the current image, this is
NVIDIA's **615.71.09** driver from NVIDIA's own apt repository, built against
the open-source `nvidia-kernel-open-dkms` kernel module (NVIDIA no longer
ships the closed kernel module on this driver branch). That open kernel
module supports Turing and newer GPUs:

| Architecture       | Year | GeForce series                          |
|--------------------|------|------------------------------------------|
| Turing             | 2018 | GeForce 16 series, GeForce 20 series     |
| Ampere              | 2020 | GeForce 30 series                        |
| Ada Lovelace        | 2022 | GeForce 40 series                        |
| Blackwell           | 2025 | GeForce 50 series                        |

Older cards (Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal &mdash; e.g. GTX 900/10-series and
earlier) aren't supported by this proprietary path at all; they fall back to
the default NVK/nouveau path above. Also note: the proprietary driver has
**not yet been independently verified by this project on real NVIDIA
hardware with Hyprland/Wayland** &mdash; see `notes/vpinos.md` and
`notes/nvidia-proprietary.md` for the ongoing investigation.

## Sample tables

VPinFE's table list (`~/tables`) starts empty on a fresh boot. A
one-time systemd service, `vpinos-fetch-tables.service`, downloads a
small set of sample tables from
[`superhac/vpinos-test-tables`](https://github.com/superhac/vpinos-test-tables)
into it as soon as the network comes up &mdash; these used to be bundled
directly in the image, but were moved out once they pushed the ISO
close to GitHub's 2&nbsp;GB release-asset limit. Only runs if `~/tables`
is empty, so it's genuinely one-time on an **installed** system (every
boot after the first finds it already populated) and runs every boot
on a **live** session (nothing persists there anyway). No network on
first boot just means an empty table list until a later boot has one;
nothing else is affected.

## Updates: vpinball and vpinfe

`vpinball`, `vpinfe` and `vpxconfig` are not compiled into the image. They come from a
signed apt repository, [`vpinos/deb-repo`](https://github.com/vpinos/deb-repo),
whose packages are built in
[`vpinos/deb-package-builder`](https://github.com/vpinos/deb-package-builder).
The repository's source and public key are part of the image, so on an
**installed** system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

picks up new vpinball / vpinfe / vpxconfig releases and Debian security updates. A newly
built ISO always contains whatever is currently published there.

### Backports (kernel, Mesa, GPU firmware)

The image (live and installed) has `trixie-backports` enabled alongside
`trixie`, `trixie-updates` and `trixie-security`, all with the
`main contrib non-free non-free-firmware` areas. An apt preference
(`/etc/apt/preferences.d/vpinos-backports.pref`) makes the **kernel, Mesa and
GPU firmware** follow backports, so `sudo apt upgrade` on an installed system
brings newer versions of those as backports publishes them. Notes:

- **Reboot after a kernel update.** The previous kernel stays installed and
  can be chosen from the GRUB menu if the new one misbehaves.
- Everything else stays on trixie. Backports are opt-in in Debian, so to take
  any other package from there, ask for it explicitly:
  `sudo apt install -t trixie-backports <package>`.
- Because those packages track backports, kernel/Mesa updates can change GPU
  behavior between releases &mdash; if something regresses after an upgrade,
  boot the older kernel from GRUB and report it.

## Security notes

VPinOS is a single-purpose cabinet image and ships with a **known default
password** (`vpinos` / `vpinos`) and an **SSH server** installed for remote
maintenance. On any cabinet that is reachable from a network, change the
password after installing (`passwd`), and don't expose it to the internet.

## Building from source

You need Docker; everything else happens inside the `vpinos-builder`
container defined by the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).

```bash
docker build -t vpinos-builder .

docker run --rm --privileged --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work vpinos-builder lb clean
docker run --rm --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work vpinos-builder \
  lb config \
    --distribution trixie \
    --architectures amd64 \
    --binary-images iso-hybrid \
    --archive-areas "main contrib non-free non-free-firmware" \
    --bootappend-live "boot=live components username=vpinos" \
    --apt-indices false

# NOT --backports true -- trixie-backports comes from
# config/archives/vpinos-backports.list instead, pinned to a frozen
# snapshot.debian.org timestamp (the live mirror's kernel packaging
# proved unreliable). See notes/vpinos.md step 2 for the full story,
# including why config/archives/vpinos-backports.pref pins by
# `origin snapshot.debian.org`, not just by release/suite name.
#
# --apt-indices false -- drops /var/lib/apt/lists (the downloaded
# Packages/Release/Translation indices for every configured repo,
# ~168M) from the shipped image after live-build's own final
# `Apt chroot update` re-sync against the real mirrors. A
# chroot-stage hook can't do this: that re-sync runs in the later
# binary stage, after every chroot hook, and silently repopulates
# whatever a hook deletes. Nothing at runtime needs it --
# network-manager + systemd-timesyncd are already present, so
# `apt-get update` works normally the first time anyone installs
# something on a real cabinet. See notes/vpinos.md for the full story.

# Fix ownership of the generated config only -- never `chown -R` the whole
# project: it corrupts cache/bootstrap and the built image ends up with its
# base system owned by the wrong user.
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work vpinos-builder sh -c \
  'for d in config auto local .build; do [ -e "$d" ] && chown -R '"$(id -u):$(id -g)"' "$d"; done; true'

docker run --rm --privileged --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work vpinos-builder lb build
```

The ISO lands in the project root as `live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso`. Always
run the full `lb clean` &rarr; `lb config` &rarr; `lb build` cycle after
editing anything under `config/`; a bare `lb build` silently reuses stale
stages. The [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build-iso.yml) runs
this same sequence.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `config/package-lists/` | Debian packages installed into the image |
| `config/archives/` | apt preferences: kernel, Mesa and AMD firmware come from trixie-backports |
| `config/hooks/live/` | Scripts run inside the image at build time (user creation, branding, installing vpinball/vpinfe, enabling services) |
| `config/includes.chroot/` | Files copied verbatim into the image: the launcher and menu (`/usr/local/bin/`), Hyprland and systemd config, apt source and key, Calamares branding, `os-release` |
| `config/bootloaders/` | Boot splash and GRUB background artwork |
| `Dockerfile` | The reproducible build environment |
| `.github/workflows/build-iso.yml` | CI build and tag-triggered release |

`chroot/`, `binary/`, `cache/`, `.build/` and `dist/` are build output and
are not committed.

## Status

**Beta.** Early and actively developed. The build, live boot, launch path
(Hyprland &rarr; vpinball / vpinfe) and installer are working end to end.
Booting straight into the frontend on an installed cabinet is now
opt-in ("Boot on startup"). Still ahead: persistence for the live medium, and
narrowing GPU/firmware support once the target hardware is settled.
